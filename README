AirDC++ nano is a high-performance text-mode client for sharing and chatting, which can be run on Linux servers. It allows you to share files with friends and other people, for example, in the following scenarios:

- With people who have a common interest from all over the word
- Within Local/Wide area networks

The client supports Advanced Direct Connect and Direct Connect networks and encrypted transfers in both and it has been tested to operate smoothly even with millions of shared files or hundreds of terabytes of data. AirDC++ nano uses the same core as the Windows version so you can take benefit of features like multiple per-user connections, share profiles, IPv6, multithreaded hashing etc. The user interface is a heavily improved version of the one used by nanodc: https://sourceforge.net/projects/nanodc/
